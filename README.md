# CC-SCRIPTS

A collection of scripts and libraries i use with ComputerCraft: Tweaked.

Scripts:

- **Autominer**: Mines a tunnel, until it finds ore. Then it'll mine that ore vein. Very not finished right now. (Deps: Ecdysis, Tabula)
- **Cobbler**: Quite a simple program. Digs cobble in front of it, dumps it in the chest below it. For use with a cobble generator.
- **EasyDig**: Give it a width, depth and height and it'll dig the area out for you. Checks for fuel, and allows for both starting on the top or bottom of your area.
- **MineShafter**: 15 down, 5 forward. Tell it how often to repeat this, it might ask you to feed it but afterwards your mine will be automatically dug out.

Libraries:

- **Ecdysis**: A place for me to dump all turtle utility functions in, also keeps track of position and direction and includes pathfinding.
- **Tabula**: Simple extension library for tables. Printing, filtering, etc.
- **TUI**: Easy to use and "stupid" library for creating TUI's in ComputerCraft.
